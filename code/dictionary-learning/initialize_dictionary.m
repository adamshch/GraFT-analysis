function dictionary_initial = initialize_dictionary(varargin)

% dictionary_initial = initialize_dictionary(varargin)
% 
% Function to generate a random initial dictionary, or to load a dictionary
% from a file.
%  
% Use: 
%       - initialize_dictionary(n_elem, v_size) creates a radom matrix with
%       zero mean and unit variance of size (v_size)x(n_elem). The columns 
%       (the dictionary elements) are normalized to the unit circle.
%       - initialize_dictionary(n_elem, v_size, nneg) where nneg is a
%       scalar generates the dictionary from a uniform distribution, then
%       normalizes the columns to the unit circle (for non-negativity
%       constraints)
%       - initialize_dictionary(n_elem, v_size, save_name) loads the
%       dictionary from the string specified in save_name, and checks the
%       dictionary dimensions against the desired dimensions.
