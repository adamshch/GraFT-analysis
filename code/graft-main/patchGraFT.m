% Run the GraFT algorithm on a large dataset by operating on

% INPUTS:
% data:    .mat file containing
%            data.Y      (the data matrix in the original dimensions)
%            data.Yr     (the data matrix reshaped in 2d format)
%            data.sizY   (dimensions of the original dataset)
%            data.nY     (minimum value of dataset)
%          OR the original dataset in 3d/4d format in which case the user
%          chooses whether to create a memory mapped file
% K:       number of components to be found in each patch
% patches: cell array containing the start and end points of each patch

%
% OUTPUTS:
% S:       3D array of spatial components
% D:       Matrix of temporal components
% RESULTS: Results of the on individual patches
