This archive contains three colormaps that have been discussed in detail in the following article:

M. Geissbuehler and T. Lasser "How to display data by color schemes compatible with red-green
color perception deficiencies" Opt. Express 21, 9862-9874 (2013)
http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-21-8-9862


Please feel free to use them at your own convenience. A citation to the original article is of course
appreciated, however not "mandatory" :-)
